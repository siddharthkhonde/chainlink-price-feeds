# chainlink-price-feeds

1. This is a demo project that shows you how to make a crowd sourcing application that can understand pricing in USD.
2. The Chainlink Feed Registry is an on-chain mapping of assets to feeds.
3. It enables you to query Chainlink price feeds from a pair of asset and denomination addresses directly, without needing to know the feed contract addresses.
4. They enable smart contracts to retrieve the latest price of an asset in a single call, from a single contract.
5. DeFi protocols that use Chainlink often implement their own on-chain registry of token addresses to Chainlink feeds.
6. To speed up integration and ensure that protocols use the correct feeds, the Feed Registry provides a canonical on-chain registry of assets to feeds.
